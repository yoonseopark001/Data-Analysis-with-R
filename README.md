### This covers the major topics in Data Analysis with R from scratch to Machine Learning and AI

* Environment: R, Jupyter Notebook, Docker, Mac OS Catalina 10.15.x
* Initially working with Anaconda, I moved to Docker mainly because Docker can show Korean characters in R charts.
* [Install Guideline for Docker](https://datascienceschool.net/view-notebook/03c5b5a96a614ee588a74f05c720e67c/)
