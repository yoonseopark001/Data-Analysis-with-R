### This covers the major topics in Data Analysis with R from scratch to Machine Learning and AI

* Environment: R, Jupyter Notebook, Docker, Mac OS Catalina 10.15.x
* Initially working with Anaconda, I moved to Docker mainly because Docker can show Korean characters in R charts.
* [Install Guideline for Docker](https://datascienceschool.net/view-notebook/03c5b5a96a614ee588a74f05c720e67c/)

# Machine Learning
* ctree (Conditional Inference Trees) - Decision Tree with iris data  
* randomForest with iris data  
* randomForest with Mushroom data (UCI Machine Learning Repository)  
* nnet (Neural Networks) with iris data
* SVM (Support Vector Machine Learning) Classifier with iris data
* K-Means Clustering with iris data  
* KNN (N-Nearest Neighbors) with iris data  
* KNN (N-Nearest Neighbors) with two columns of iris data  
* nnet - Multinominal Logistic Regression with iris data

# Data Analysis
* Frequency Table with Survey data  
* Variation Comparison of Products with Different Means with sales data  
* Simple Linear Regression with Height and Weight data
* Simple Linear Regression with Seoul Accident Data (Comparison of Accuracy: vs. randomForest)  
* Multiple Regression with attitude data (The Chatterjeeâ€“Price Attitude Data)

# Programming
* Multiplication Tables  
* Grade Evaluation
